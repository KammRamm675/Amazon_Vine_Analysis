## Summary
  So first thing that needs to be addressed is the poor ratings.  In my opinion (paid or not) any vote lower than a 4 stars is not satisfactory.  Fro mwhat I gathered, the home entertainment products portion of Amazon is needing some severe remodeling.  Specifically speaking please refer to the "Paid Stars" image.  Yes, nothing but 4's and 5's but I would like for the attention to be put on the "verified purchase" column. NONE OF THE PURCHASES ARE VERIFIED.  As far as we know these 4's and 5's are false. Refering to the "Unpaid Stars" image, I would feel its more reliable for two reasons. one, they are unpaid and we can assume these are strictly voluntary. Two, theres more verified purchases so mroe real customers.
